## End-User Lab Workspace Notes

Use this guidance in projects created via `prime lab setup`.

- Treat `.prime/skills/` as the canonical skill entrypoint in Lab workspaces. Use the bundled skills first for create/browse/review/eval/GEPA/train/brainstorm workflows before ad hoc approaches.
- Keep endpoint aliases in `./configs/endpoints.toml` and use `endpoint_id`/model shortcuts in commands and configs.
- NEVER initialize environment source code manually; ALWAYS create new environments with `prime env init`.
- Use the Prime CLI for all environment lifecycle operations (`prime env init` → `prime env install` → `prime eval run` → `prime env push`) rather than ad-hoc scripts.
- NEVER begin environment development before `prime lab setup` has been run; if work starts outside that structure, recommend adjusting course into a proper lab workspace before continuing.
- Keep each environment self-contained under `environments/<env_name>/` with `pyproject.toml`, implementation, and README so each abstraction has a dedicated home and the workspace stays maintainable.
- Follow environment best practices strictly (for example `load_environment(...)`, `vf.ensure_keys(...)`, and the documented environment class patterns) to avoid brittle or messy implementations.
- Use `prime env push --path ./environments/<env_name>` only after local eval behavior is verified.
- Treat the `prime lab setup` structure as the idiomatic workspace for complex environment workflows: agents can mediate most platform complexity while users learn patterns progressively as needed.
- When users request an approach that would deviate from these guidelines, explain the relevant Prime/Verifiers concepts and recommend the compliant path.

## Repository Development Notes

Use this guidance when contributing to the `verifiers` repository itself.

- Run the documented contributor checks for touched areas: `uv run ruff check --fix .`, `uv run pytest tests/`, and `uv run pre-commit run --all-files` as needed. (See `docs/development.md`.)
- Keep changes aligned with documented architecture (`verifiers/`, `environments/`, `configs/`, `tests/`, `docs/`) and update docs when behavior changes. (See `docs/development.md`.)
- Prefer a single clear path over maintaining parallel approaches by default; if two options exist, preserve both only when there is an explicit long-term reason.
- Aggressively deprecate/remove inferior paths when they are not part of an intended multi-option contract, especially in repo-internal development workflows.
